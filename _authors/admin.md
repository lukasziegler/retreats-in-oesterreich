This project is run by [Retreats Near You](https://retreatsnearyou.com/), a passion-project from [Lukas Ziegler](https://lukasziegler.com/). 

Lukas is a curious, passionate and open-minded human being. His love for mindfulness and meditation began 2012. Since then he has been on his journey of self-discovery and exploring different ways how mindfulness can touch all facets of life. After working as a web developer and UX designer for several years, he realized his true calling: making a positive impact on the world and living a healthy, joyful life in the process.

With this project Lukas aims to connect like-minded change-makers in Austria, fostering a stronger local community and creating positive change globally. Lukas's side-projects embody his desire to push boundaries and leave a lasting positive impact on his surroundings.
