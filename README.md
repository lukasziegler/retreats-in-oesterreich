# Retreats in Ã–sterreich

Welcome to the project of [Lukas Ziegler](https://lukasziegler.com/)
This GitHub repo is still in the making and the goal is to have a simple one-pager up and running, that can be used to validate the business case and the product-market-fit, before spending more design and engineering efforts.

If you are interested and equally as passionate, then reach out to me via the [contact form](https://retreats-in-oesterreich.at/kontakt/).

The code base is based on the Jekyll blog theme "Dann" built by [Artem Sheludko](https://jekyllthemes.io/developers/artem-sheludko). Here is the [live demo](https://dann-jekyll.netlify.app/) where you can see the original theme.

## Installation

If this is your first time using Jekyll, please follow the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and make sure your local environment (including Ruby) is setup correctly.


### Deployment

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.

I would recommend checking the [Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/) page on Jekyll website.
